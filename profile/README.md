# Soundform Labs

**Cue Smarter. Sync Better.**  
Professional-grade audio technologies for live production, theater, and creative control.

## What we do

Soundform Labs builds powerful, open-source tools for:

- **Audio Cueing Engines** — A modern and free alternative to QLab
- **Timecode-Based Automation** — MIDI Timecode, LTC, and show sync
- **Production-Ready Toolkits** — Built with engineers, for engineers

## Our Philosophy

We believe pro audio deserves open tools, that work beautifully, sync seamlessly,
and never get in the way of creativity.
